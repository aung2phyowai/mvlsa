\section{Conclusion}
Through the results in Table~\ref{tab:c} we demonstrated that fusing
multiple data sources through the procedure of GCCA is an effective
method to improve the performance of word representations. We also
demonstrated that GCCA could be used even over a monolingual dataset
thereby giving a more principled alternative of LSA which removed the
need for manually fusing the word-word coccurrence matrices through
reciprocal weighted averaging \cite{pennington2014glove}. We also
provided least counts of significant changes for the commonly used
datasets used to evalue word embeddings. 

%% The inter algorithm pearson correlation before and after performing
%% GCCA showed  we see that the
%% systems (word2vec and the Multiview LSA) are making the same types of
%% predictions so the systems are producing a very similar representation
%% even though the absolute performance on the extrinsic metrics differs
%% by a lot sometimes.
