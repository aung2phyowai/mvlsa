	Year = {2011},
	Abstract = {<p>Work on modeling semantics in text is progressing quickly, yet there are few
                existing public datasets which authors can use to measure and compare their
                systems. This work takes a step towards addressing this issue. We present the MSR
                Sentence Completion Challenge Data, which consists of 1,040 sentences, each of
                which has four impostor sentences, in which a single (fixed) word in the original
                sentence has been replaced by an impostor word with similar occurrence
                statistics. For each sentence the task is then to determine which of the five
                choices for that word is the correct one. This data was constructed from Project
                Gutenberg data. Seed sentences were selected from Sherlock Holmes novels, and
                then imposter words were suggested with the aid of a language model trained on
                over 500 19th century novels. The language model was used to compute 30
                alternative words for a given low frequency word in a sentence, and human judges
                then picked the 4 best impostor words, based on a set of provided guidelines.
                Although the data presented here will not be changed, this is still a work in
                progress, and we plan to add similar datasets based on other sources. This
                technical report is a living document and will be updated appropriately as new
                datasets are constructed and new results on existing datasets (for example, using
                human subjects) are reported.</p>},

	Abstract = {<p>In this paper, we describe a new, publicly available corpus intended to
                stimulate research into language modeling techniques which are sensitive to
                overall sentence coherence. The task uses the Scholastic Aptitude Test‚{\"A}{\^o}s sentence
                completion format. The test set consists of 1040 sentences, each of which is
                missing a content word. The goal is to select the correct replacement from
                amongst five alternates. In general, all of the options are syntactically valid,
                and reasonable with respect to local N-gram statistics. The set was generated by
                using an N-gram language model to generate a long list of likely words, given the
                immediate context. These options were then hand-groomed, to identify four decoys
                which are globally incoherent, yet syntactically correct. To ensure the right to
                public distribution, all the data is derived from out-of-copyright materials from
                Project Gutenberg. The test sentences were derived from five of Conan Doyle‚{\"A}{\^o}s
                Sherlock Holmes novels, and we provide a large set of Nineteenth and early
                Twentieth Century texts as training material.</p>},
